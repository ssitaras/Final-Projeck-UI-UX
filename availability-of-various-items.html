            <h4>ONLINE AVAILABILITY OF AN ITEM</h4>
            <p>We recommend that you check our website for all the latest news and availability of our items. If the size of the item you are interested in is out of stock, but you have the Coming soon option, then you can email us and we will let you know if it is back in stock within the next 15 days. If it's not available by that deadline, it expires and you have to register it again. This process is not equivalent to a reservation.</p>
            <p>In some items, we may display messages in the form of multiple units for a particular size. If it's one you like, we encourage you to buy it so you don't run out. Please note that any items in the cart are not reserved. If your cart contains some items that are no longer available, we'll let you know so you can delete them and complete the remainder of your purchase.</p>
            <p class="note"><span>On the page of each item you will find our various suggestions to complete your look or various similar products that you may be interested in.</span></p>
            <h4>AVAILABILITY OF AN ITEM IN A STORE</h4>
            <p>Via Zara.com you can check stock in our various stores thanks to the View availability in store option. Simply select the items you're interested in and their location and we'll show you the closest available stores. We remind you that information on stock in our various stores is only indicative.</p>
            <p>If you are in one of our Zara stores and the clothing you are interested in is not in stock, our staff can help you complete your online purchase via the store tool.</p>
